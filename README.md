# Ode to an awesome advisor
We are trying to write this together as a group


## Happies

- seeing everybody on campus is fun
- getting to work part-time for the company I intered for
- seeing all my friends on campus

## Crappies

- being in a classroom at 8 is ... tough
- missing two class periods for sleep
- having an 8 am and an 8 pm on class on the same day
